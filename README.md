# Youtube New Tab Ext

This chrome extension allows you to paste youtube links and will open the youtube link as an embed URL in a new tab. It was inspired by a chat with @icseon. Hopefully it's useful!

- Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.
