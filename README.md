# Youtube New Tab Ext

This chrome extension allows you to paste youtube links and will open the youtube link as an embed URL in a new tab. It was inspired by a chat with [@icseon](https://github.com/icseon). Hopefully it's useful!

I didn't spend much more than an hour with chatgpt and testing this practically, so it goes without saying, this is an effortless mess. Feel free to push whatever you'd like here, I don't plan on posting this to the Chrome Extension Store as it was just some random fun thing thrown together.

Q: The "Paste YouTube URL here" box is slightly wider than the other two buttons below it.
A: Next question please.

Q: Did I just ge--
